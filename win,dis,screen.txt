Document and window:

   As a JavaScript developer, you've likely encountered the document and window objects numerous times. 
While they may seem similar, these two objects serve distinct purposes and have different properties and methods.
In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve into the differences between document and window objects, exploring their roles,
properties, and use cases.screen or just screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.

Document:
    The document object represents the HTML document that is currently loaded in the browser. 
It is a part of the Document Object Model (DOM), which is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. 
The document object provides access to the document's structure, content, and properties.

window:
     The window object represents the browser window that contains the document. 
It is the top-most object in the Browser Object Model (BOM) and provides access to the browser's properties and methods. 
The window object is often referred to as the global object, as it is the root object of the JavaScript environment

screen:
      The screen object in JavaScript is a part of the Browser Object Model (BOM) and provides 
information about the user's screen. It's a read-only object, meaning you can't modify its properties.

Key differences between document and window objects

Scope: The document object is specific to the current HTML document, whereas the window object is related to the browser
 window that contains the document.
Properties and Methods: The document object has properties and methods that are primarily focused on the document's
 structure and content, such as document.title, document.body, and document.getElementById(). In contrast, the window 
 object has properties and methods that are related to the browser window, such as window.location, window.history, 
 and window.open().

 Key differences between window, screen, and document:

window represents the browser window, while document represents the HTML document loaded in that window.
screen represents the user's screen, which is separate from the browser window and document.
window is the global object in a browser context, while document and screen are properties of the window object.
